# kbproject
An open source, free custom keyboard vendor and inventory repository

## Why
So, the keyboard community has a massive amount of vendors. Each vendor chooses their software, their design, their server. The end result is a confusing, obtuse process to try and find products. Want a 60% plate? Check the 50+ vendors in the community to see who sells one.

This project scrapes each seller's site, gets their site data, and combines it into a single database. This allows for a fast, efficient process for finding what you want.

Spend more time building and typing, spend less time searching.
